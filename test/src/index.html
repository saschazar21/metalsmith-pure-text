    <p>
      This is a metalsmith plugin I searched for a long time, however I haven't found anything similar to this. Therefore I came up with writing my own plugin.
    </p>
    <h2>Functionality</h2>
    <p>
      The core functionality is to provide a sanitized string containing only text without any HTML tags or else. This is necessary for some actions like mentioned in post.md
    </p>
    <h2>Foundation</h2>
    <p>
      This plugin is based on <a href="https://github.com/dbashford/textract">textract</a>, therefore it should support multiple file formats.
